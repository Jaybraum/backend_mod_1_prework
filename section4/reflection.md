## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

I added the chrome extension in the beginning of the course and I have noticed a sense of freshness after every POM. I set my pom for 30 min because I felt myself getting cut off when on a good flow. I am still playing with the times to see what works best. It will just be a case of toggling what feels good to get it just right.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I found myself a lot more focused for sure, however as I mentioned previously I am still in the process of finding the work/rest time ratio that fits best. I found myself ignoring the pom until I felt I came to a complete thought. Regarding setting intentions, I moved too fast through my lists sometimes and other times I would be stuck on something that I wouldn’t realize would take me a longer period of time to accomplish. This is understandable as i can control my understanding of the difficulty of these exercises, as time goes on I’ll have a better understanding of how long a potential task may take and be able to map out how much I can get done during the focus period.

1. In your own words, what is a Class?

A class is a creation of a group to categorize things

1. What is an attribute of a Class?

An attribute of a class would be its characteristics.

1. What is behavior of a Class?

Behavior is what the class can do, more actionable

1. In the space below, create a Dog class with at least 2 attributes and 2 behaviors:

```rb
class Dog
  attr_reader :name, :weight,

  def initialize(name, weight)
    @name = name
    @name = weight
  end
  def run
    puts "run"
  end
  def jump
    puts "jump"
  end
end

```

1. How do you create an instance of a class?

Give your instance a name and set it = to the class previously defined

1. What questions do you still have about classes in Ruby?
