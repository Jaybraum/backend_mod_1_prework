## Section 1 Reflection

1. **How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?**

As someone who has varied in career and hobby choices, the idea of being a super learner is such a valuable skillset to try new things. I have seen these super learner habits previously and one of the techniques that I have always been fond of incorporating is to teach others what you have learned. I think the idea of being able to simplify and play with information helps you to retain. For this course I’d like to incorporate more reading, I’ve found myself slacking a bit as of recently, but no worries, I’m sure this course will fill that void. One thing that I think is also important that could be added is organization, it doesn’t mean you necessarily have to be a neat freak, but understanding how information pertains to the environment you create could help.

2. **How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?**

5. **In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`**
```ruby
animal = "zebra"
```
6. **How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?**

print animal
```
7. **What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.**
```ruby
print "Interlopation would be to use the word #{animal} like this."
```
8. **What method is used to get input from a user?**
```ruby
get.chomp

9. **Name and describe two common string methods:**
- `.split` is a way to list out your string as an array.
- `.length` tells you how many characters are in your string, including spaces.
