## Section 3 Reflection

1. **What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?**

Practicing S.M.A.R.T. goals was the first point that resonated with me. I like being organized with a plan, so anytime I see a breakdown based on setting specific and measurable goals I’m all about it. Additionally, striving to improve my Zone of Proximal Development was such a good way to look at where I am currently in my knowledge, it can work as a meter to gauge.

2. **In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?**

As I just mentioned the S.M.A.R.T. goals are something I am very familiar with. I like to map out achievable goals in short periods to accumulate to the main target. I’d say an area that I will need to improve on will be not being afraid to seek help. Seeking help is not something I don’t do entirely but it will definitely be something that I can improve on.

3. **What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?**

A Hash is a collection of data with key value pairs, where as an array will list data a Hash will assign values to the data entered.

4. **In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.**

```ruby
pet_store = {"dogs":8, "cats":5, "birds":5}
```

5. **Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?**

```ruby
puts states[:"Iowa"]
```

6. **With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?**

```ruby
states.keys
states.values
```

7. **What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?**

We could use a hash for classrooms to list all the kids in a grade or classroom. The reason a hash is better is because it holds more data.
